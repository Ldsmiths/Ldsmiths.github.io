                <h3 class="h3">Project Overview</h3>

                <div class="mb-5">
                  <p>People want to experiment with new mixed drinks, but lack the confidence to execute due to confusing instructions and precise measurements. HomeMix is a mock-up for a mobile app that allows users to discover mixed drink recipes and be guided through the creation using augmented reality.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="h3">Research</h3>
                <p>With the problem statement in mind, I conducted 10 in-person interviews to gain qualitative information to identify challenges people experience throughout the process of making mixed drinks at home. This group ranged from amateurs who reported “pouring Coke until I can’t taste the rum” to bartenders with professional experience. </p>

                <p>Research Goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discover what common methods people use when making their own drinks.</li>
                    <li>Identify frustrations people face when making drinks.  </li>
                    <li>Recognize differences in technique by experience level.</li>
                    <li>Find ways people would like to improve the experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>From these interviews, was able to group most of the user pain points into 4 categories: <strong>Recipe Knowledge</strong>, <strong>Ingredients/Resources</strong>, <strong>Execution</strong>, and <strong>Habits</strong>.</p>

                    <p>One common finding among the less experienced was a lack of knowledge on mixed drink possibilities, causing them to stick to what they know. Further, some expressed concern about the cost and availability of certain ingredients, with one individual commenting “I try to keep it simple because I feel like a lot of cocktails require things like bitters, triple sec, and syrups. Those can be expensive and it’s not like I have them just laying around.” </p>
                    
                    <p>On the secret to getting drinks right, one bartender said “I fortunately have had mentors along the way, sharing their insight and style…the number one rule is to measure each component for a drink’s consistency, integrity, and quality”.</p>

                <p>Based on this research, I created a target user persona. I found those interested in cocktails with little to no bartending experience to be the individuals facing the most challenges when attempting to concoct mixed drinks at home. This user profile highlights the goals, frustrations, and motivations of a member of this target audience. </p>

            <h3 class="h3">Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>To gain an idea of what is currently available on the market, I analyzed products (2 mobile apps, 1 physical glass) that aim to help individuals discover drink recipes and create cocktails at home. I identified strengths and weaknesses based on personal experience and user reviews. </p>

            <h3 class="h3">Ideation</h3>
            <p>I began brainstorming ideas for mobile app features that could help solve the challenges users face when making mixed drinks at home. I took inspiration from the existing apps, particularly around searchable interfaces, but my goal was to create a unique solution that these competitors did not satisfy. Below are the 3 key features I determined to be most valuable, serving as the foundation for the HomeMix app. </p>
            <p><strong>Recipes:</strong> Users can discover new recipes, receive recommendations, and see detailed instructions</p>
            <p><strong>Searchable Database:</strong> Users can sort through recipes with filters and descriptive keywords </p>
            <p><strong>Augmented Reality:</strong> AR technology will recognize a drink glass and guide the user through steps to make drinks in real-time</p>

            <p>I first created a paper prototype which I tested with two users who were interested in making cocktails at home, but didn’t feel confident in their abilities. The test followed a simple script of a first-time user opening the app, browsing recipes (via a limited number of search options), selecting a drink, accessing its recipe details, and launching the augmented reality function. </p>
            <p>This paper prototype validated that our user flow felt natural to our target persona. It also highlighted ways to improve communication of information. By encouraging the users to think aloud at each step of the process, I gained valuable insight such as what information  was most valuable to provide, what features were important (social media integration ranked low), and what questions they had as they navigated the app for the first time. </p>
            <p>Next, I created a high-fidelity clickable prototype. This prototype allows users to explore various ways of discovering drink recipes, including searching by keywords, exploring suggested drinks via the home menu, and filtering by base, strength, or difficulty. </p>
            <p>Although technological limitations prevent testing of the augmented reality portion, a visual prototype can be seen below, demonstrating how this process is intended to work. </p>
            <p>This high-fidelity prototype was created to alleviate the 4 challenges identified during the research phase: 1) Recipe Knowledge, 2) Ingredients/Resources, 3) Execution, and 4) Habits.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A deep database of recipes allows users to discover new drinks and view detailed instructions. </li>
                <li>The ability to search and filter allows users to find drinks based on ingredients they already have at home. </li>
                <li>Augmented Reality integration visualizes the process, guiding the user and making the drink creation easy. </li>
                <li>These features combined in a single mobile app aims to make this a fun, useful experience that can break old habits, encouraging users to discover and try new drinks.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This prototype was tested with 5 users, allowing me to again gain valuable insights as the test users talked through their thought processes while using the app. </p>

           <h3 class="h3">Iterate</h3>
            <p>After testing the initial high-fidelity prototype, some of the most common feedback was users wanting the ability to apply multiple filters simultaneously to narrow the drink selection. I took this into consideration and redesigned the filter page to allow users to apply multiple filters at once, along with the ability select multiple items within each category. </p>

            <p>The filter page was also given a more minimalistic design, eliminating the background pictures for each filter button. This allows more content to fit on the screen and creates a simpler look that is easier for the user to navigate. </p>
